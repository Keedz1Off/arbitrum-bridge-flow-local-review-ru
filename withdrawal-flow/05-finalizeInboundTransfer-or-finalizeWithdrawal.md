## Код функции

    address _token,
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes calldata _data

## Function Explanation

`finalizeInboundTransfer(...)` / `finalizeWithdrawal(...)` finalizes the withdrawal on L1.

Эта функция is executed after the L2 -> L1 message is proven or accepted by the bridge system.

Main idea:

```text
Only an authentic L2 withdrawal message should release funds on L1.
```

This is where message data becomes real L1 token release.

---

## Важные моменты логики

### Authentication Check

The function must verify that the message came from the expected L2 gateway through the correct bridge path.

Weak authentication here can allow forged withdrawals.

---

### Decoded Transfer Values

The function usually receives or decodes:

- token
- sender
- recipient
- amount
- extra data

These values must match the message created on L2.

---

### Release Step

After verification, this function releases escrowed L1 tokens to the recipient.

The release amount should match the verified burned amount from L2.

The counterpart gateway must be the expected gateway.
```

### Main Invariant 3

Decoded amount must match the amount burned on L2.
```

## Additional Invariants

### Additional Invariant 1

```text
Decoded recipient must match the intended L1 recipient.
```

### Additional Invariant 2

```text
Decoded token must match the correct L1 token.
```

### Additional Invariant 3

```text
The same withdrawal message must not finalize twice.
```
