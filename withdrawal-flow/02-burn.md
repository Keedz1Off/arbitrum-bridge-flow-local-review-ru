# Function Review: burn(...)

## Код функции

```solidity
function outboundEscrowTransfer(
    address _l2Token,
    address _from,
    uint256 _amount
) internal virtual returns (uint256 amountBurnt) {
    // this method is virtual since different subclasses can handle escrow differently
    // user funds are escrowed on the gateway using this function
    // burns L2 tokens in order to release escrowed L1 tokens
    IArbToken(_l2Token).bridgeBurn(_from, _amount);
    // by default we assume that the amount we send to bridgeBurn is the amount burnt
    // this might not be the case for every token
    return _amount;
}
```

## Function Explanation

`burn(...)` is the L2 accounting step in the withdrawal flow.

Эта функция removes the user's L2 token balance before the bridge requests release on L1.

Main idea:

```text
L1 must release only what was actually burned on L2.
```

If this step does not happen correctly, the bridge may release L1 escrow without proper L2 backing.

## Важные моменты логики

### Burn Logic

If the function burns tokens, it should reduce the user's L2 balance or token supply.

Это создает the economic basis for releasing tokens on L1.

---

### Amount Used Downstream

Amount used in the L1 withdrawal message should match the real burned amount.

If burn fails or moves a different amount, the withdrawal message must not proceed with the wrong value.

## Инварианты

### Main Invariant 1

```text
Tokens must be burned before L1 release.
```

### Main Invariant 2

```text
burned amount must equal L1 released amount.
```

### Main Invariant 3

```text
Failed burn must stop the withdrawal flow.
```

## Additional Invariants

### Additional Invariant 1

```text
Token being burned must be the intended L2 token.
```

### Additional Invariant 2

```text
Amount used downstream must match the real burned amount.
```

### Additional Invariant 3

```text
L1 release must not happen without successful L2 burn.
```
