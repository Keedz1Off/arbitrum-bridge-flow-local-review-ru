## Function Explanation

`outboundTransfer(...)` / `withdraw(...)` is the main L2 entry point for starting a withdrawal back to L1.

User calls this function when they want to move value from L2 to L1.

At a high level, this function usually:

- receives withdrawal parameters from the user
- selects the correct token/gateway path
- burns tokens on L2
- builds calldata for L1 finalization
- creates the outbound L2 -> L1 message

Main idea:

```text
The L1 release message must represent what actually happened on L2.
```

---

## Важные моменты логики

### User Inputs

Important values usually include:

- token
- recipient
- amount
- extra data

These values must not corrupt the withdrawal message.

---

### Token / Gateway Selection

The selected L2 token must map to the correct L1 token and gateway.

```text
L2 token -> correct L1 token / gateway
```

Wrong mapping may release the wrong asset on L1.

---

### Burn Step

The function should burn the user's L2 token balance before L1 release can happen.

```text
burned on L2 -> released on L1
```

If the message is created without a real burn, L1 may release unbacked funds.

## Инварианты

### Main Invariant 1

```text
L2 burned amount must equal L1 released amount.
```

### Main Invariant 2

```text
The selected L2 token must map to the correct L1 token.
```

### Main Invariant 3

```text
The L1 recipient must match the intended recipient.
```

## Additional Invariants

### Additional Invariant 1

```text
burn must happen before L1 release is finalized.
```

### Additional Invariant 2

```text
Amount encoded for L1 must match the real burned amount.
```

### Additional Invariant 3

```text
The outbound message must target the correct L1 gateway.
```

### Additional Invariant 4

```text
The withdrawal message must not be finalized twice.
```
