## Function Explanation

`createRetryableTicket(...)` creates the L1 -> L2 retryable ticket.

In the deposit flow, this is the step where prepared calldata is submitted to Arbitrum so it can later execute on L2.

Main idea:

```text
The retryable ticket transports the deposit message from L1 to L2.
```

Эта функция is important because a valid retryable ticket can still be dangerous if it targets the wrong L2 contract or contains wrong calldata.

---

## Важные моменты логики

### L2 Target

The retryable ticket must target the correct L2 gateway.

```text
wrong L2 target = wrong execution path
```

If the target is wrong, the message may fail or execute unintended logic.

---

### Calldata Passed to L2

The calldata passed into the retryable ticket should already contain verified deposit values.

Important values:

- amount
- token
- recipient
- finalize selector

The ticket should not carry corrupted or user-overridden bridge data.

---

### Gas and Refund Parameters

Retryable tickets depend on execution budget and refund addresses.

Important values may include:

- gas limit
- max fee per gas
- max submission cost
- excess fee refund address
- call value refund address

If these values are unsafe, the deposit may become delayed, fail, or redirect value unexpectedly.

## Инварианты

### Main Invariant 1

```text
Retryable ticket must target the correct L2 gateway.
```

### Main Invariant 2

```text
Retryable calldata must match the verified L1 deposit.
```

### Main Invariant 3

```text
Retryable execution budget must be sufficient for finalization.
```

## Additional Invariants

### Additional Invariant 1

```text
Refund handling must not corrupt bridge accounting.
```

### Additional Invariant 2

```text
The ticket must not allow the same deposit to be finalized twice.
```
