## Function Explanation

`finalizeInboundTransfer(...)` finalizes the deposit on the destination chain.

For the deposit flow, this function is executed on L2 after the L1 -> L2 message arrives.

Main idea:

```text
Only an authentic bridge message should be able to finalize a deposit.
```

Эта функция is critical because it turns decoded cross-chain message data into real L2 token credit.

---

## Важные моменты логики

### Authentication Check

If the function checks `msg.sender`, bridge messenger, or counterpart gateway, this is the auth boundary.

The function must make sure the call came from the expected bridge path.

Weak auth here can allow forged deposits.

---

### Address Aliasing

In Arbitrum, if an L1 contract sends a message to L2, the L2 side may see an aliased sender address.

```text
raw L1 gateway address != aliased L2 sender address
```

If this function checks the raw address when it should check the aliased address, sender validation may be wrong.

---

### Decoded Transfer Values

Эта функция usually receives or decodes:

- token
- sender
- recipient
- amount
- extra data

These values must match what was encoded on L1.

---

### Mint / Release Step

After validation, this function may call mint or inbound escrow release logic.

That final token credit must use the verified amount and recipient.

## Инварианты

### Main Invariant 1

```text
Only an authentic L1 -> L2 bridge message may finalize a deposit.
```

### Main Invariant 2

```text
The counterpart gateway must be the expected gateway.
```

### Main Invariant 3

```text
Address aliasing must be handled correctly when relevant.
```

## Additional Invariants

### Additional Invariant 1

```text
Decoded amount must match the amount backed by L1 escrow.
```

### Additional Invariant 2

```text
Decoded recipient must match the intended L2 recipient.
```

### Additional Invariant 3

```text
Decoded token must match the correct token mapping.
```

### Additional Invariant 4

```text
The same message must not finalize twice.
```
