## Function Explanation

`AbsInbox._createRetryableTicket(...)` is the lower-level Arbitrum Inbox step that creates or records the retryable ticket.

Эта функция is closer to the message system than to token accounting.

Main idea:

```text
The Inbox creates the L1 -> L2 message, but the caller must provide correct bridge parameters.
```

Even if the Inbox logic works correctly, the bridge can still be unsafe if it passes the wrong target, calldata, gas values, or refund addresses.

---

## Важные моменты логики

### Message Creation

Эта функция inserts the retryable ticket into the Arbitrum messaging flow.

The important bridge values are already packed before this step.

So the key issue is whether the values passed into this function are already correct.

---

### Sender Semantics and Address Aliasing

For Arbitrum, if an L1 contract sends a message to L2, the L2 side may see an aliased version of the L1 contract address.

Simple idea:

```text
L1 contract sender -> aliased L2 sender
```

If the L2 finalize function checks the wrong sender form, authentication can break.

---

### Refund and Payment Logic

Retryable ticket creation involves submission cost, gas funding, and refund addresses.

This does not directly decide token amount, but it can affect whether the L2 message executes successfully and where unused value is refunded.

---

## Инварианты

### Main Invariant 1

```text
The retryable ticket must preserve the intended L2 target.
```

### Main Invariant 2

```text
The retryable ticket must preserve the intended calldata.
```

### Main Invariant 3

```text
L2 sender assumptions must match Arbitrum aliasing rules.
```

## Additional Invariants

### Additional Invariant 1

```text
Gas and payment values must be sufficient for message creation/execution.
```

### Additional Invariant 2

```text
Refund behavior must not redirect value in an unintended way.
```
